## Scope

This document describes the standard field process for installing fiber cement lap siding on residential structures.  
It applies to single-family and low-rise residential buildings using wood-frame construction with exterior sheathing.

This document focuses on physical installation execution, water management, and clearance requirements.

---

## 1. Pre-Installation Planning and Verification

Before installation begins:

- Confirm siding type, profile, and exposure requirements
- Verify framing and sheathing are flat, plumb, level, and structurally sound
- Confirm wall assembly includes a continuous water-resistive barrier (WRB)
- Identify required clearances at grade, roofs, decks, and penetrations
- Verify local code requirements for wind load, fastening, and joint treatment
- Photograph wall conditions prior to installation

Siding must not be installed over:
- Irregular or damaged framing
- Missing or improperly installed WRB
- Surfaces subject to standing water

---

## 2. Material Storage and Handling

- Store siding flat, dry, and covered
- Keep material elevated off ground
- Do not install saturated or wet siding
- Carry boards on edge to prevent breakage
- Protect corners and edges from impact damage

Improper storage may result in shrinkage, cracking, or joint separation.

---

## 3. Wall Preparation and Water Management

Before siding installation:

- Confirm WRB is installed continuously with properly integrated flashing
- Flash all penetrations, windows, doors, and transitions
- Install required Z-flashing, kickout flashing, and drip edges where applicable
- Verify roof-to-wall and deck-to-wall flashing is present and correct

The siding system is not a primary water barrier.  
Water management must be handled by the WRB and flashing system.

---

## 4. Starter Course Installation

- Install a starter strip at the base of the wall
- Starter strip thickness must match siding thickness
- Ensure consistent angle and alignment of first course
- Maintain required clearance from grade and hard surfaces

Typical minimum clearances:
- Grade to siding: approximately 6 inches
- Hard surfaces (slabs, paths, steps): approximately 1–2 inches
- Roof surfaces: minimum 1 inch

---

## 5. Course Layout and Sequencing

- Install siding courses horizontally from bottom to top
- Maintain consistent exposure across all elevations
- Stagger vertical joints between adjacent courses
- Use joint flashing or approved joint treatment at all butt joints
- Do not rely solely on caulking as a primary joint waterproofing method

Courses must remain straight, level, and uniformly spaced.

---

## 6. Fastening Principles

General fastening requirements:

- Fasteners must penetrate framing or approved structural sheathing
- Fasteners must be corrosion-resistant
- Drive fasteners perpendicular to the wall surface
- Fastener heads must sit snug against siding without crushing

Blind nailing is preferred unless local code requires face nailing.

Improper fastening includes:
- Over-driven fasteners
- Under-driven fasteners
- Angled fasteners
- Fasteners missing framing

---

## 7. Clearances and Transitions

Maintain required clearances at all transitions:

- Roof-to-wall intersections
- Decks, balconies, and stairs
- Ground and finished grade
- Gutters and fascia
- Masonry and concrete interfaces

Do not caulk horizontal clearance gaps intended for drainage.

---

## 8. Cutting and Field Modifications

- Cut fiber cement using approved dust-reduction methods
- Follow applicable silica safety standards
- Treat all field-cut edges with approved sealant or coating
- Avoid cutting indoors with power saws

All exposed cut edges must be sealed to prevent moisture intrusion.

---

## 9. Joint Treatment

At vertical joints:

- Install joint flashing behind butt joints, or
- Use approved joint covers where applicable

Caulking may be used as a supplemental measure but is not a substitute for flashing unless specifically allowed by product and code.

---

## 10. Finishing and Touch-Up

- Remove protective laminate immediately after each course (if applicable)
- Touch up minor edge damage per manufacturer guidelines
- Do not overuse touch-up materials
- Replace damaged boards rather than attempting large repairs

---

## 11. Final Inspection and Documentation

Upon completion:

- Verify clearances are maintained at all interfaces
- Confirm flashing is visible and properly integrated
- Check for cracked, broken, or misaligned boards
- Confirm fasteners are properly seated
- Photograph all elevations and key details
- Document any deviations or field conditions

---

## Notes

- Siding performance depends on proper water management behind the cladding
- Do not install siding in contact with standing water
- Do not use siding as trim, fascia, or soffit material unless specifically designed for that application
- Installation must comply with applicable local building codes
