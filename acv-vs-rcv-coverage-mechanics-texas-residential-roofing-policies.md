### 3.3 Payment Characteristics

Under ACV:

- Depreciation is permanent
- No second payment is issued
- Payment may not cover full replacement
- Deductible is subtracted from depreciated value

Older roofs may receive significantly reduced payouts.

## 4. Texas-Specific Policy Trends

In Texas, insurers increasingly:

- Convert aging roofs to ACV at renewal
- Apply wind/hail-specific deductibles
- Impose percentage-based deductibles (1%–5%)
- Restrict cosmetic-only damage coverage

Policyholders must review declarations pages annually to confirm:

- Roof coverage type
- Deductible structure
- Wind/hail endorsement language

---

## 5. Wind and Hail Deductible Structures

Texas policies commonly include:

- Separate wind/hail deductibles
- Percentage-based deductibles tied to dwelling value
- Higher deductibles for named storms

Example:

$300,000 dwelling coverage  
2% wind/hail deductible = $6,000 deductible

Deductible applies before any payout calculation.

## 6. Depreciation Considerations for Asphalt Shingle Roofs

Depreciation commonly considers:

- Shingle type (3-tab vs laminated)
- Installation quality
- Ventilation adequacy
- Maintenance history
- Exposure conditions

Accelerated aging may affect depreciation calculations.

Improper installation does not automatically eliminate coverage but may affect causation disputes.

---

## 7. Recoverable Depreciation Requirements (RCV Policies)

To recover withheld depreciation, insurers typically require:

- Signed contract
- Invoice or proof of payment
- Completion photos
- Final inspection approval
- Supplements approved prior to invoicing

Failure to complete repairs may result in forfeiture of recoverable depreciation.

---

## 8. Common Claim Friction Points

Disputes frequently arise over:

- Roof age determination
- Useful life assumptions
- Partial slope vs full replacement scope
- Matching requirements
- Code upgrade allowances (law and ordinance coverage)
- Overhead and profit inclusion
- Measurement discrepancies

These issues relate to scope and valuation — not coverage existence.

---

## 9. Interaction With Hail and Wind Damage

Coverage type does not determine whether damage exists.

Damage determination is based on:

- Physical evidence
- Storm timing
- Causation analysis

Coverage type only determines how payment is calculated after covered damage is confirmed.

---

## 10. Inspection and Documentation Standards

For insurance-related roofing projects, documentation should include:

- Date of loss
- Weather event data
- Roof age (approximate)
- Shingle type
- Number of layers
- Pre-existing conditions
- Photographs of damage and undamaged areas
- Measurement documentation
- Line-item estimate comparison

Documentation supports scope clarity but does not alter coverage terms.

---

## 11. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Interpret individual insurance policies
- Provide legal advice
- Represent the policyholder in negotiations
- Replace licensed public adjuster or legal counsel
- Guarantee claim outcomes

It explains valuation mechanics only.

---

## Notes

- ACV policies cost less but pay less.
- RCV policies require repair completion for full payout.
- Deductibles apply regardless of coverage type.
- Roof age significantly affects ACV settlements.
