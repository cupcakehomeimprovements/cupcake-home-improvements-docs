## Scope

This document defines the principles and field standards for managing water intrusion in residential exterior construction.

It applies to roofing, wall assemblies, window and door openings, siding systems, and gutter systems.

This document serves as an umbrella reference aligning all trade-specific installation documents under a unified water-management framework.

## 1. Purpose of Water Management Systems

Water management in residential construction is the intentional control of moisture to:

- Shed bulk water away from the structure  
- Prevent water intrusion at transitions and penetrations  
- Allow assemblies to drain and dry when incidental moisture occurs  

No single product provides water control. Performance depends on layering, sequencing, and continuity across assemblies.

---

## 2. Governing Principles

These principles apply universally across all exterior assemblies:

1. **Gravity governs drainage**  
   Water must be directed downward and outward at every layer.

2. **Layers must be shingled**  
   Upper layers must overlap lower layers so water exits to the exterior.

3. **Drainage over sealant**  
   Sealants supplement flashing but do not replace drainage paths.

4. **Continuity matters**  
   Water control layers must remain continuous across transitions.

5. **Clearances enable drying**  
   Separation between materials prevents capillary action and allows airflow.

6. **Transitions are failure points**  
   Roof-to-wall, wall-to-opening, wall-to-grade, and roof edges require explicit detailing.

---

## 3. Types of Water Exposure

Water affects structures through multiple mechanisms:

- **Bulk water** – rain runoff, splashback, roof discharge  
- **Wind-driven water** – pressure forcing water behind cladding  
- **Capillary action** – water wicking between tight material interfaces  
- **Backflow** – water redirected by improper laps or obstructions  

Condensation and vapor diffusion are separate phenomena and are not addressed by flashing systems.

---

## 4. Water Control Layers

Exterior assemblies rely on multiple functional layers:

- **Primary shedding layer**  
  Roofing materials, siding, trim  

- **Drainage plane**  
  Underlayment and water-resistive barriers (WRB)  

- **Flashing systems**  
  Components that direct water from one plane to another  

- **Sealants**  
  Air control and secondary water resistance only  

Each layer must function independently and collectively.  
Failure of one layer increases dependence on others.

---

## 5. Flashing Components (Conceptual Overview)

Flashing elements redirect water at transitions and interruptions:

- Drip edge at eaves and rakes  
- Step flashing at roof-to-wall intersections  
- Kickout flashing at roof-to-wall terminations  
- Head flashing (drip caps)  
- Sill pan concepts at openings  
- End dams to prevent lateral water migration  
- Penetration flashings (pipe boots, vents)  
- WRB integration tapes and membranes  

Flashing must always discharge water to the exterior surface.

---

## 6. Assembly-Specific Water Management

### 6.1 Roof Edge and Roof-to-Wall Transitions

- Roof edges must direct water into gutters or away from fascia  
- Step flashing must be layered with roofing materials  
- Counterflashing protects step flashing from surface exposure  
- Kickout flashing is required where roof planes terminate into walls  
- Chimneys require both step flashing and counterflashing  
- Pipe boots must remain flexible and intact  

---

### 6.2 Wall Cladding and Terminations

- Siding is not a waterproof barrier  
- WRB provides the primary drainage plane  
- Flashing is required at all penetrations  
- Required clearances must be maintained:
  - Siding to roof surfaces  
  - Siding to grade or hardscape  
- Butt joints rely on flashing, not sealant alone  

---

### 6.3 Window and Door Openings

Openings are high-risk water intrusion points.

Key principles:

- The sill acts as the primary water collection point  
- Head flashing must shed water outward  
- Side flashing must direct water back to the drainage plane  
- WRB integration must be layered above the opening  

Cut-back installations allow improved continuity between WRB, flashing, and interior finishes.  
Pocket-fit installations limit access to existing water control layers and rely on existing conditions.

Not all water management components can be verified without invasive inspection.

---

### 6.4 Deck Ledgers and Structural Attachments

- Deck ledgers penetrate the water control plane  
- Flashing must divert water away from ledger connections  
- Improperly flashed deck attachments are a common failure point  
- Sealants alone are insufficient at structural penetrations  

---

### 6.5 Gutter Systems and Discharge

- Gutters must collect roof runoff at the edge, not behind fascia  
- Drip edge must direct water into the gutter  
- Fascia must be structurally sound prior to attachment  
- Downspouts must discharge water away from foundations  
- Splashback and erosion must be controlled at termination points  

Gutters are part of the overall water management system.

---

## 7. Common Failure Modes

Common causes of water intrusion include:

- Reverse laps in flashing or WRB  
- Missing kickout flashing  
- Sealant-only butt joints  
- Inadequate material clearances  
- Water flowing behind gutters  
- Unflashed penetrations  
- Flat or unprotected sills  
- Discontinuous drainage planes  

These conditions should be documented during inspection.

---

## 8. Inspection and Documentation

Water management evaluation requires documentation:

- Photograph each elevation  
- Photograph roof edges and penetrations  
- Photograph roof-to-wall transitions  
- Photograph window and door perimeters  
- Document attic staining or moisture indicators  
- Note conditions that cannot be verified without removal  

Observed conditions should be recorded without assumption.

---

## 9. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Replace manufacturer installation instructions  
- Interpret building codes or engineering requirements  
- Address insurance or claim handling  
- Define pricing, warranties, or sales processes  

It provides construction-level principles only.
