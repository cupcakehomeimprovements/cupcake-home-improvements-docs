## About This Procedure

This document reflects field practices developed and validated by **Cupcake Home Improvements**, a Central Texas exterior remodeling contractor specializing in roofing, windows, siding, and building envelope performance.

## Scope

This document defines standard installation sequencing and identifies common field constraints encountered during residential exterior construction projects. It applies across roofing, window replacement, siding installation, and gutter systems.

The purpose of this document is to establish order-of-operations discipline and document conditions that can affect scope, timing, safety, and performance outcomes.

---

## 1. Purpose of Installation Sequencing

Proper sequencing ensures that:

- Water management layers remain continuous
- Work completed earlier is not compromised by later trades
- Safety risks are minimized
- Rework and scope conflicts are reduced
- Field conditions are documented before concealment

Incorrect sequencing is a common cause of premature failures, delays, and disputes.

---

## 2. General Sequencing Principles

The following principles apply to all exterior construction work:

1. **Water management first**  
   Drainage planes and flashing must be established before cladding or finish materials.

2. **Top-down logic**  
   Work generally proceeds from roof to walls to openings to accessories.

3. **Irreversible work last**  
   Finish materials should not be installed until underlying conditions are verified.

4. **Access-dependent work early**  
   Tasks requiring open access should be completed before obstructions are created.

5. **Documentation before concealment**  
   Conditions must be photographed before they are covered.

---

## 3. Typical High-Level Installation Sequence

While each project varies, a typical exterior project follows this order:

1. Site preparation and protection
2. Inspection and documentation of existing conditions
3. Removal or exposure of affected components
4. Structural or substrate repairs (if required)
5. Water management layers and flashing
6. Primary exterior installations (roofing, windows, siding)
7. Secondary systems (gutters, trim, accessories)
8. Final inspection and documentation

Any deviation from this sequence should be documented with cause.

## 4. Roofing-Related Sequencing Considerations

### Key sequencing requirements

- Roofing tear-off must precede flashing replacement
- Underlayment and ice-and-water protection must be installed before roofing materials
- Roof-to-wall flashing must be coordinated with siding and WRB
- Roofing should be completed before gutter installation

### Common constraints

- Weather exposure during tear-off
- Multiple existing roofing layers
- Decking damage discovered after removal
- Limited access for material staging or debris removal

---

## 5. Window Installation Sequencing Considerations

### Key sequencing requirements

- Window openings must be evaluated prior to ordering
- Water management at the opening must be established before setting the window
- Interior and exterior finishes must not interfere with flashing continuity

### Common constraints

- Unknown existing flashing conditions
- Limited access to WRB in pocket-fit installations
- Interior finish conditions affecting cut-back feasibility
- Occupied homes requiring phased or staged work

---

## 6. Siding Installation Sequencing Considerations

### Key sequencing requirements

- WRB and flashing must be complete prior to siding installation
- Windows and doors should be installed before siding where possible
- Required clearances must be maintained at roofs, decks, and grade

### Common constraints

- Uneven framing or sheathing
- Hidden rot or substrate damage discovered during removal
- Decks, porches, or hardscapes limiting clearances
- Weather exposure during partial wall removal

---

## 7. Gutter Installation Sequencing Considerations

### Key sequencing requirements

- Roofing and drip edge installation must be complete
- Fascia condition must be verified prior to attachment
- Downspout discharge paths must be identified before final placement

### Common constraints

- Concealed fascia rot
- Landscaping or hardscapes affecting discharge
- Roof geometry concentrating water volume
- Limited attachment points due to framing layout

---

## 8. Structural Movement and Post-Foundation Repair Constraints

Certain exterior installations are sensitive to ongoing structural movement. When foundation repair or structural stabilization has occurred, installation sequencing must account for potential settlement or adjustment.

### General considerations

- Foundation repairs may involve ongoing soil movement, pier adjustment, or load redistribution
- Structural movement can continue for weeks or months following repair
- Installing rigid exterior components before stabilization increases the risk of misalignment, cracking, or seal failure

Observed conditions should be evaluated before proceeding with exterior work.

---

### Trade-Specific Sensitivity

**Replacement Windows**  
Window openings are highly sensitive to movement due to tight tolerances and rigid framing interfaces. It is commonly recommended that window installation be deferred for an extended stabilization period following foundation repair to reduce the risk of opening distortion, glass stress, or seal failure.

**Roofing Systems**  
Roofing assemblies are generally more tolerant of minor movement but may still be affected at flashing points, roof-to-wall transitions, and penetrations. A shorter stabilization period is often observed before roof replacement, depending on the scope and nature of the foundation repair.

**Siding Systems**  
Siding systems fall between windows and roofing in sensitivity. Panel alignment, joint spacing, and clearance maintenance can be affected by ongoing movement. Evaluation of wall plane alignment and fastener conditions is recommended prior to installation following structural repair.

---

### Documentation and Evaluation

When foundation repair or structural movement is known or suspected:

- Document the type and timing of foundation work
- Photograph affected openings, walls, and roof planes
- Evaluate plumb, level, and square conditions
- Note visible cracking, binding, or misalignment
- Defer irreversible installations when movement risk is present

Final sequencing decisions should be based on observed conditions rather than assumptions.

---

## 9. Site Access and Logistics Constraints

Installation sequencing is often influenced by site conditions, including:

- Driveway access limitations
- Vehicle clearance for material delivery or dump trailers
- Proximity of parked or immobile vehicles
- Overhead power lines or utilities
- Tree coverage or landscaping obstacles

Material staging and debris management should be planned before work begins.

---

## 10. Occupied Structure Constraints

When work occurs on occupied homes:

- Noise-sensitive activities may require scheduling adjustments
- Interior access may be limited or phased
- Daily weatherproofing may be required
- Work hours may be restricted

Sequencing should minimize disruption while maintaining safety and performance.

---

## 11. Weather and Environmental Constraints

Environmental conditions affecting sequencing include:

- Rain and moisture exposure
- Temperature limits for materials and sealants
- Wind conditions affecting safety
- Seasonal daylight limitations

Weather-driven delays should be documented.

---

## 12. Discovery of Unforeseen Conditions

Common discoveries impacting sequencing include:

- Hidden rot or structural damage
- Improper prior installations
- Code noncompliance
- Pest or animal intrusion
- Incompatible materials or assemblies

When discovered:

- Work should pause in the affected area
- Conditions should be documented with photographs
- Scope adjustments should be reviewed before proceeding

---

## 13. Documentation Standards

Throughout the installation process:

- Photograph conditions before and after each major phase
- Document deviations from planned sequencing
- Record constraints impacting installation order
- Retain evidence of concealed conditions

Documentation protects both performance outcomes and accountability.

---

## Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Define trade-specific installation steps
- Replace manufacturer installation instructions
- Establish pricing or scheduling guarantees
- Address insurance or contract administration

It provides sequencing logic and constraint awareness only.
