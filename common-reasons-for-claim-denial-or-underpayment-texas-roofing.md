## Scope

This document outlines common technical and construction-based reasons residential asphalt shingle roofing claims are denied, partially denied, or underpaid in Texas wind and hail loss scenarios.

It applies to:

- Steep-slope asphalt shingle roofing systems  
- Residential properties  
- Wind and hail-related losses  

This document focuses strictly on observable construction and documentation factors.  
It does not interpret policy language or provide legal advice.

---

## 1. Damage Does Not Meet Deductible Threshold

### 1.1 Insufficient Measurable Damage

Claims may not result in payment when:

- Total repair cost falls below the applicable deductible  
- Damaged areas are limited and repairable  
- Only cosmetic damage is observed without functional impairment  

Technical causes include:

- Limited number of wind-creased shingles  
- Isolated hail impacts without mat fracture  
- Minor granular displacement without structural compromise  

Documentation must clearly distinguish between cosmetic and functional damage.

---

## 2. No Evidence of Functional Hail Damage

### 2.1 Cosmetic vs Functional Damage

Hail impacts on laminated asphalt shingles must typically result in:

- Fracture of fiberglass reinforcement mat  
- Displaced or crushed granules exposing asphalt substrate  
- Bruising detectable through tactile testing  
- Softened impact zones  

Granule displacement alone is not always considered functional damage.

Impacts smaller than approximately 1 ¼ inch in diameter may not cause mat fracture in laminated fiberglass shingles.

### 2.2 Improper Impact Identification

Common misidentifications include:

- Blistering mistaken for hail  
- Mechanical damage (foot traffic) mistaken for impact  
- Manufacturing irregularities mistaken for hail  
- Old impact marks from prior storms  

Failure to differentiate these conditions can lead to denial.

---

## 3. Wind Damage Does Not Meet Replacement Threshold

### 3.1 Repairable Conditions

Wind-related damage may be deemed repairable when:

- Isolated shingles are creased but not widespread  
- Tabs are lifted but not fractured  
- Damage is limited to one slope  

Replacement may not be approved unless damage exceeds repair thresholds.

---

## 4. Pre-Existing Damage

Claims are frequently denied when damage is determined to be:

- Long-term wear and tear  
- Thermal cracking unrelated to wind  
- Granule loss from aging  
- Mechanical damage predating storm event  

Indicators of pre-existing damage include:

- Uniform aging patterns  
- Multiple storm dates without documentation  
- Repairs previously performed  
- Brittle shingle condition without creasing pattern  

Pre-loss condition documentation is critical.

---

## 5. Deferred Maintenance

Insurance coverage does not typically extend to:

- Rot caused by long-term leaks  
- Deteriorated pipe boots from aging  
- Flashing failure from corrosion  
- Improper installation from prior work  

If deterioration is unrelated to a single storm event, coverage may be limited or denied.

---

## 6. Improper Installation Conditions

Damage disputes may arise when the roof exhibits:

- High nailing patterns  
- Under-driven or over-driven fasteners  
- Improper starter installation  
- Improper flashing sequencing  
- Inadequate ventilation  

Carriers may argue that damage resulted from installation defects rather than storm forces.

---

## 7. Insufficient Documentation

Claims may be underpaid or denied due to:

- Lack of close-up impact photos  
- No collateral damage documentation  
- No slope identification  
- No date-of-loss clarity  
- Incomplete measurement documentation  

Technical documentation should include:

- Marked test squares  
- Photo evidence of mat fracture  
- Collateral indicators (metal dents, soft metals, screens)  
- Elevation labeling  

Incomplete evidence weakens claim support.

---

## 8. Age-Related Coverage Limitations

Some Texas policies include:

- Actual Cash Value (ACV) roof endorsements  
- Age-based depreciation schedules  
- Roof surface exclusions beyond certain age thresholds  

Older roofs may receive reduced settlement even when storm damage is confirmed.

This document does not interpret policy terms but acknowledges technical impact on claim outcome.

---

## 9. Multiple-Layer Roofing Systems

Claims involving multiple roofing layers may face limitations when:

- Additional layers violate local code  
- Fastener length cannot achieve proper deck penetration  
- Removal is required for proper restoration  

Coverage disputes may occur when carriers argue only surface damage is covered.

---

## 10. Dispute Over Cause of Loss

Carriers may attribute observed conditions to:

- Thermal expansion and contraction  
- Manufacturer defects  
- Installation error  
- Foot traffic  
- Hail below functional threshold  

Clear distinction between storm-related damage and other causes must be documented.

---

## 11. Improper Scope Development

Underpayment may result from:

- Underestimated roof area  
- Missing line items (flashing, ridge vent, drip edge)  
- Inadequate steep-charge application  
- Missing code upgrades  

Construction-level scope review is necessary to identify omissions.

---

## 12. Late Reporting of Claim

Delayed claim reporting may result in:

- Inability to verify date of loss  
- Intervening weather events  
- Additional deterioration complicating cause determination  

Storm date verification supports claim viability.

---

## 13. Cosmetic Damage Exclusions

Some policies include cosmetic exclusions for:

- Metal components  
- Soft metals (vents, gutters)  
- Surface appearance changes without performance impairment  

Functional damage must be distinguished from cosmetic impact.

---

## 14. Inspection Limitations

Damage may go undocumented when:

- Steep slopes are not accessed  
- Drone imagery lacks close-up detail  
- No test squares are performed  
- Interior attic inspection is omitted  

Incomplete inspection increases denial risk.

---

## 15. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Interpret insurance contracts  
- Provide legal guidance  
- Serve as public adjuster instruction  
- Guarantee claim approval  

It identifies construction-based technical factors that commonly affect claim outcomes in Texas residential asphalt shingle roofing losses.
