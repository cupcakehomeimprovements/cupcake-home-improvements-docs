## Scope

This document describes the standard lifecycle of a residential roofing insurance claim in Texas involving wind and/or hail damage to asphalt shingle roofing systems.

It applies to:

- Single-family and low-rise residential dwellings  
- Asphalt/fiberglass laminated or 3-tab shingle systems  
- Wind and hail-related losses  
- Replacement Cost Value (RCV) and Actual Cash Value (ACV) residential property policies  

This document focuses on procedural flow, documentation requirements, inspection standards, payment sequencing, and construction-related claim considerations.

This document does not provide legal interpretation or public adjusting services.

## 1. Loss Event and Initial Assessment

### 1.1 Storm Event

Typical triggering events include:

- Hail impact events  
- Straight-line wind events  
- Microbursts  
- Tornadic activity  
- Combined wind and hail events  

In Central Texas, most residential roof claims are hail-driven with associated wind effects.

---

### 1.2 Post-Storm Indicators

Common observable indicators include:

- Missing or displaced shingles  
- Creased shingles (wind damage)  
- Hail impact marks on soft metals  
- Dented gutters, downspouts, and vents  
- Granule displacement  
- Interior water intrusion  

Initial documentation should begin immediately.

---

## 2. Notice of Loss (Claim Initiation)

### 2.1 Filing the Claim

The policyholder files a First Notice of Loss (FNOL) with their carrier.

Required information typically includes:

- Date of loss  
- Cause of loss (hail, wind, or combined)  
- Description of observed damage  
- Property address and policy number  

Texas policies often contain specific timelines for reporting loss.

---

## 3. Adjuster Inspection Process

### 3.1 Carrier Assignment

The insurer assigns:

- Staff adjuster, or  
- Independent adjuster  

An inspection is scheduled at the property.

---

### 3.2 Inspection Components

Inspection typically includes:

- Roof surface evaluation  
- Soft metal impact evaluation  
- Vent and accessory inspection  
- Interior leak confirmation (if applicable)  
- Photographic documentation  

In Texas hail claims, adjusters commonly evaluate:

- Mat fracture beneath shingle surface  
- Consistency of impact pattern  
- Collateral damage indicators  
- Wind directionality patterns  

---

### 3.3 Coverage Determination

The adjuster determines:

- Covered vs. non-covered damage  
- Repair vs. full replacement eligibility  
- Scope of work required  

Texas carriers may apply:

- Age-based roof limitations  
- Cosmetic damage exclusions  
- ACV-only roof endorsements  

Policy form controls final determination.

---

## 4. Estimate and Scope of Loss

### 4.1 Carrier Estimate

The carrier generates a scope of loss, often using estimating software such as Xactimate.

The estimate typically includes:

- Line-item quantities  
- Unit pricing  
- Depreciation  
- Deductible application  
- Overhead and profit (if applicable)  

---

### 4.2 Payment Structure

Texas residential roofing claims typically include:

- Replacement Cost Value (RCV)  
- Depreciation (recoverable or non-recoverable)  
- Deductible (often wind/hail-specific)  
- Actual Cash Value (ACV) initial payment  

Example structure (RCV policy):

Replacement Cost Value (RCV)  
– Depreciation  
= Actual Cash Value (ACV)  
– Deductible  
= Initial Claim Payment  

Recoverable depreciation is released after proof of completed repairs.

---

## 5. Deductible Structure (Texas Context)

Texas policies frequently contain:

- Separate wind/hail deductible  
- Percentage-based deductible (commonly 1%–5% of dwelling coverage)  
- Flat deductible options  

Wind/hail deductibles are often higher than “all other perils” deductibles.

The deductible is the policyholder’s responsibility.

---

## 6. ACV vs. RCV Policy Mechanics

### 6.1 Replacement Cost Value (RCV)

- Pays full replacement cost  
- Depreciation is recoverable upon completion  
- Requires proof of repair  

---

### 6.2 Actual Cash Value (ACV)

- Depreciation is not recoverable  
- Payment reflects age and condition  
- Older roofs may result in limited payout  

Texas carriers may convert older roofs to ACV-only endorsements at renewal.

---

## 7. Contractor Involvement

### 7.1 Damage Documentation

A contractor may:

- Document storm-related damage  
- Identify overlooked components  
- Provide supplemental documentation  

Contractors do not interpret policy language.

---

### 7.2 Scope Review

Common scope discrepancies include:

- Missing code-required components  
- Omitted steep or high charges  
- Omitted ventilation upgrades  
- Underestimated accessory replacement  
- Drip edge or flashing not included  

Supplement requests may be submitted with supporting documentation.

---

## 8. Supplement Process

Supplements may occur due to:

- Discovered decking damage  
- Code-required upgrades  
- Material price changes  
- Additional line items required for proper installation  

The carrier may:

- Approve  
- Partially approve  
- Request additional documentation  

Proper documentation is required for consideration.

---

## 9. Repair or Replacement Execution

Upon scope agreement:

- Contract is executed  
- Materials are ordered  
- Work is scheduled  

Roof replacement must comply with:

- Local building codes  
- Manufacturer installation standards  
- Wind uplift requirements  

Texas municipalities may require:

- Drip edge installation  
- Specific ventilation ratios  
- Ice and water barrier in certain jurisdictions  

---

## 10. Completion and Depreciation Recovery

For RCV policies:

- Contractor provides certificate of completion  
- Invoice submitted to carrier  
- Carrier releases recoverable depreciation  

Failure to complete repairs within the policy timeframe may affect depreciation recovery.

---

## 11. Common Grounds for Partial or Full Denial

In Texas residential roofing claims, denials or reductions may occur due to:

- Damage below deductible  
- Pre-existing damage  
- Improper installation  
- Wear and tear exclusions  
- Age-based ACV limitations  
- Insufficient storm-related impact density  
- Failure to mitigate damage  

Inspection quality and documentation directly affect outcomes.

---

## 12. Documentation Standards

Throughout the claim process:

- Photograph all elevations  
- Document collateral damage  
- Photograph shingle test squares  
- Document ventilation and flashing conditions  
- Maintain copies of estimate and payment summaries  

All documentation should be retained for recordkeeping.

---

## 13. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Provide legal advice  
- Interpret specific policy forms  
- Act as public adjusting services  
- Guarantee claim approval  
- Address litigation or appraisal processes  

This document provides a construction-level procedural overview only.
