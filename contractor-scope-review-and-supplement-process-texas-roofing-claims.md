## Scope

This document outlines the standard contractor protocol for reviewing insurance carrier scopes of loss and submitting supplements on Texas residential asphalt shingle roofing claims.

It applies strictly to:

- Residential structures  
- Steep-slope asphalt shingle roofing systems  
- Wind and hail-related insurance claims  

This document defines construction-based scope validation and non-litigious supplement procedures.

It does not constitute public adjusting, legal representation, or policy interpretation.

---

## 1. Purpose of Scope Review

An insurance carrier’s scope of loss is an estimate of covered repairs based on the adjuster’s inspection.

The contractor’s responsibility is to:

- Verify that the scope reflects actual construction requirements  
- Identify omissions, inaccuracies, or code-required items  
- Submit documentation supporting necessary revisions  

The objective is accurate restoration — not adversarial negotiation.

---

## 2. Initial Scope Review Procedure

### 2.1 Quantity Verification

Verify:

- Roof square count by slope  
- Ridge and hip linear footage  
- Valley linear footage  
- Starter course quantities  
- Underlayment quantities  
- Waste factor application  

Confirm measurements align with actual field dimensions.

---

### 2.2 Line Item Verification

Confirm inclusion of:

- Tear-off of all layers (if applicable)  
- Ice and water protection where required  
- Drip edge at eaves and rakes  
- Step flashing replacement  
- Counterflashing (if applicable)  
- Pipe boots and penetration flashings  
- Ridge vent replacement  
- Starter shingles  
- Hip and ridge shingles  
- Ventilation components  
- Code-required upgrades  

Missing line items should be documented clearly.

---

### 2.3 Material Consistency

Ensure the scope reflects:

- Correct shingle type (laminated vs 3-tab)  
- Correct pitch factor  
- Correct story height  
- Proper steep-charge application (if applicable)  
- Proper waste allowance  

Material mismatches must be identified before work begins.

---

## 3. Code and Ordinance Considerations (Texas)

Texas municipalities may require:

- Ice and water protection in specific zones  
- Drip edge at both eaves and rakes  
- Ventilation compliance  
- Deck re-nailing (where applicable)  

Where code upgrades apply:

- Reference applicable municipal code  
- Provide documentation or inspector requirements  
- Include photos when applicable  

Code-driven supplements must be construction-based, not preference-based.

---

## 4. Common Scope Omissions

Typical omissions include:

- Underestimated square count  
- Missing starter or ridge quantities  
- Omitted flashing replacement  
- Omitted ventilation upgrades  
- Insufficient steep or high-charge adjustments  
- No allowance for damaged decking  
- Insufficient disposal fees  

Each omission must be supported with documentation.

---

## 5. Supplement Submission Protocol

### 5.1 Documentation Standards

Each supplement should include:

- Clear written explanation of omission  
- Supporting photos  
- Measurement verification (if applicable)  
- Applicable code reference (if required)  
- Revised line item request  

Supplements must be itemized and structured.

---

### 5.2 Communication Standards

When communicating with carriers:

- Remain factual and concise  
- Avoid policy interpretation statements  
- Avoid adversarial language  
- Reference observable construction requirements only  

Example:

“Step flashing replacement is required due to full tear-off and reinstallation of roofing materials at roof-to-wall intersections.”

Avoid:

“This must be paid.”

---

## 6. Decking Supplements

If decking damage is discovered during tear-off:

- Photograph damaged decking before removal  
- Identify location by slope  
- Measure square footage affected  
- Submit decking replacement request promptly  

Decking supplements must be submitted before covering work proceeds when possible.

---

## 7. Depreciation and Recoverable Depreciation (RCV Policies)

On Replacement Cost Value (RCV) policies:

- Initial payment may reflect depreciation  
- Final depreciation is typically recoverable upon proof of completion  

Contractor responsibility:

- Provide final invoice  
- Provide completion photos  
- Confirm total cost aligns with approved scope  

The contractor does not determine depreciation methodology.

---

## 8. ACV Policy Considerations

On Actual Cash Value (ACV) policies:

- Depreciation is not recoverable  
- Carrier payment may be limited by roof age  

Contractor responsibility remains:

- Accurate construction scope  
- Transparent documentation  
- Clear communication with homeowner  

The contractor does not advise on coverage structure.

---

## 9. Non-Litigious Philosophy

This process is intended to:

- Resolve scope discrepancies through documentation  
- Maintain professional communication  
- Avoid unnecessary escalation  
- Preserve working relationships  

Escalation to appraisal or legal action is outside the contractor’s standard role.

---

## 10. Final Scope Confirmation

Before beginning work:

- Confirm approved scope  
- Confirm deductible responsibility  
- Confirm material selections  
- Confirm code items addressed  

No construction should proceed on assumptions.

---

## 11. Documentation Archive

Maintain a complete claim file including:

- Original carrier scope  
- Revised supplements  
- Photo documentation  
- Code references  
- Communication log  
- Final invoice  

Proper recordkeeping supports transparency and accountability.

---

## 12. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Provide legal advice  
- Interpret insurance policy language  
- Act as public adjuster guidance  
- Guarantee claim approval or supplement payment  

It defines contractor-level construction validation standards for Texas residential asphalt shingle roofing claims.
