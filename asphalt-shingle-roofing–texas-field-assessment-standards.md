## Scope

This document defines the field standards for evaluating hail damage to residential asphalt shingle roofing systems in Texas.

It applies to:

- Laminated (architectural) asphalt shingles  
- 3-tab asphalt shingles  
- Fiberglass-reinforced asphalt shingle systems  
- Wind and hail loss events in Central Texas  

This document focuses on identifying functional hail damage, distinguishing it from cosmetic conditions, and documenting observable indicators relevant to residential insurance claims.

This document does not interpret insurance policy language.

## 1. Characteristics of Hail Events in Texas

Texas hail events vary widely in:

- Hailstone diameter  
- Density and fall rate  
- Wind speed and direction  
- Duration of impact  
- Angle of impact  

Functional damage to fiberglass-reinforced asphalt shingles typically requires:

- Solid hailstones  
- Approximately 1¼ inch diameter or larger  
- Sufficient kinetic energy upon impact  

Impact severity depends on both hail size and wind velocity.

---

## 2. Types of Hail Damage to Asphalt Shingles

### 2.1 Functional Damage

Functional damage affects the water-shedding capability or service life of the roofing system.

Indicators may include:

- Fracture of the fiberglass reinforcement mat  
- Bruising beneath the shingle surface  
- Cracks radiating from impact points  
- Punctures or tears  
- Loss of protective granules exposing asphalt substrate  

Functional damage reduces long-term weather resistance.

---

### 2.2 Cosmetic Damage

Cosmetic damage may include:

- Minor granule displacement without mat fracture  
- Surface scuffing  
- Dents in soft metals without shingle impairment  
- Isolated marks inconsistent with storm pattern  

Cosmetic damage does not necessarily impair water-shedding performance.

Coverage determination depends on policy language.

---

## 3. Identifying Mat Fracture (Bruising)

Mat fracture is a key indicator of functional hail damage.

Field evaluation may involve:

- Light tactile pressure over suspected impact area  
- Detection of soft spots or crushed substrate  
- Granule displacement surrounding impact  
- Circular or elliptical impact pattern  

A fractured reinforcement mat compromises shingle integrity.

Visible surface damage is not always present.

---

## 4. Granule Displacement Analysis

Granule displacement alone does not confirm hail damage.

Evaluation considerations:

- Random vs. directional pattern  
- Density of impacts per test area  
- Fresh asphalt exposure  
- Embedded granules in gutters  
- Uniform aging vs. isolated impact clusters  

Granule loss from aging is typically:

- Evenly distributed  
- Concentrated in high-flow areas  
- Not circular in shape  

Hail impacts typically appear:

- Random but clustered  
- Consistent in size  
- Repeated across multiple slopes  

---

## 5. Test Squares and Sampling Methodology

Field documentation commonly includes:

- Selection of representative test areas  
- 10’ x 10’ sampling squares  
- Identification of consistent impact density  
- Comparison across slopes  

Evaluation should consider:

- North vs. south slopes  
- Windward vs. leeward exposure  
- Shaded vs. sun-exposed areas  

Hail rarely impacts only a single slope.

---

## 6. Collateral Indicators

Collateral damage supports hail event verification.

Common collateral indicators include:

- Dents in soft metals (vents, flashing, gutters)  
- Impact marks on HVAC fins  
- Dented downspouts  
- Window screen tears  
- Fence staining or impact  
- Vehicle dents in surrounding area  

Collateral damage alone does not confirm roof mat fracture but strengthens storm event correlation.

---

## 7. Wind-Driven Hail Considerations

Wind may alter impact angle.

Indicators include:

- Directional impact patterns  
- Damage concentrated on specific elevations  
- Creased shingles from combined wind uplift  

Wind damage and hail damage frequently occur together.

Shingle creasing typically indicates wind uplift rather than hail impact.

---

## 8. Differentiating Hail Damage from Other Conditions

### 8.1 Blistering

Blistering appears as:

- Raised bubbles  
- Random asphalt expansion  
- No reinforcement fracture  

Blistering is manufacturing or aging-related, not impact-related.

---

### 8.2 Mechanical Damage

Mechanical damage may include:

- Foot traffic scuffs  
- Tool strikes  
- Ladder damage  
- Improper installation damage  

Mechanical damage often has:

- Linear patterns  
- Scraping characteristics  
- Irregular shapes  

---

### 8.3 Thermal Cracking and Aging

Thermal cracking:

- Follows shingle pattern  
- Appears along tabs  
- Is consistent across slopes  

Hail impacts are:

- Circular or elliptical  
- Randomly distributed  
- Concentrated based on storm direction  

---

## 9. Roof Age and Impact Susceptibility

Factors affecting hail response include:

- Roof age  
- Shingle brittleness  
- Ventilation quality  
- Installation method  
- Underlying decking support  

Older shingles may:

- Fracture more easily  
- Shed granules more rapidly  
- Exhibit pre-existing brittleness  

Age alone does not confirm hail damage.

---

## 10. Documentation Standards

Proper documentation includes:

- Wide-angle elevation photos  
- Close-up impact photos  
- Photographs of collateral damage  
- Photos of gutters and downspouts  
- Marked test squares  
- Slope identification  

All images should include contextual reference points.

Inspection findings should record:

- Date of inspection  
- Observed impact density  
- Observed slope conditions  
- Areas inaccessible for safety reasons  

---

## 11. Limitations of Surface Evaluation

Hail damage evaluation is limited to observable conditions.

Certain conditions cannot be verified without:

- Lifting shingles  
- Removing test samples  
- Conducting destructive testing  

Non-invasive inspection does not guarantee detection of all functional damage.

---

## 12. Texas-Specific Considerations

Central Texas hail patterns often include:

- High-density impact clusters  
- Large-diameter stones in localized zones  
- Combined wind and hail events  
- Significant soft metal collateral damage  

Microburst events may produce directional impact patterns.

Documentation should account for regional storm behavior.

---

## 13. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Interpret insurance policy coverage  
- Provide legal claim advice  
- Guarantee claim approval  
- Serve as public adjusting services  

This document provides field-level damage evaluation standards only.
