## Scope

This document describes the standard field process for installing residential replacement windows using block frame methods.

It applies to single-family and low-rise residential structures where windows are installed **without nail fins**, using pocket-fit or cut-back techniques.

This is a construction execution guide, not a manufacturer installation manual.

## 1. Pre-Installation Preparation

### 1.1 Site and Opening Verification

- Confirm window size, configuration, and orientation
- Verify opening type:
  - Pocket-fit (existing frame retained)
  - Cut-back (interior drywall trimmed to allow deeper frame set)
- Confirm wall type (brick, siding, stucco, masonry)
- Identify existing head flashing or water management features
- Photograph each elevation prior to removal

### 1.2 Safety and Protection

- Use appropriate PPE
- Protect interior flooring, furnishings, and wall surfaces
- Protect exterior siding, brick, and landscaping
- Confirm lead-paint precautions on older homes

---

## 2. Removal of Existing Window

### 2.1 General Removal Principles

- Remove sashes, screens, balances, and hardware
- Avoid damaging surrounding wall assemblies
- Minimize disturbance to exterior cladding where possible
- Dispose or recycle removed materials per local requirements

### 2.2 Frame Removal (as Required)

For full-frame removals:

- Cut fasteners and release frame from opening
- Preserve existing head flashing when serviceable

For pocket replacements:

- Retain structurally sound frame components
- Remove stops, tracks, and obstructions as needed

### 2.3 Documentation of Existing Conditions

Document existing conditions with photos:

- Rot
- Corrosion
- Water staining
- Previous misapplication

---

## 3. Opening Evaluation and Preparation

### 3.1 Structural Inspection

Inspect exposed framing or existing frame for:

- Rot
- Delamination
- Inadequate fastening

Repair or replace compromised materials before proceeding.

### 3.2 Opening Geometry

The opening must be:

- Plumb
- Level
- Square
- Structurally sound

Adjust with treated blocking or shims as required.

### 3.3 Interior Cut-Back (When Required)

- Trim drywall returns to allow window frame to sit flush with interior plane

This method:

- Increases visible glass area
- Improves thermal performance by reducing frame exposure
- Allows deeper frame placement

---

## 4. Water Management and Flashing

### 4.1 Head Flashing

- Install or preserve sloped head flashing
- Flashing must:
  - Extend beyond the opening width
  - Drain to the exterior
  - Integrate with existing WRB where present

### 4.2 Sill and Jamb Preparation

- Clean all contact surfaces
- Apply sealant beads at:
  - Jamb-to-sheathing interfaces
  - Corner transitions
- Apply flashing tape as appropriate for wall assembly
- Do not trap water or block drainage paths

---

## 5. Setting the Window

### 5.1 Dry Fit

- Test-fit window in opening
- Verify:
  - Frame depth compatibility
  - Interior and exterior alignment

### 5.2 Shimming

- Set sill shims first
- Shim at:
  - Corners
  - Meeting rails
  - Mullion points
- Keep shims back from exterior edge to allow backer rod and sealant

---

## 6. Fastening and Alignment

### 6.1 Structural Attachment

- Secure window using approved fasteners or installation clips
- Fasten through frame or clip locations per window type
- Avoid over-driving fasteners

### 6.2 Final Alignment Verification

Confirm:

- Plumb
- Level
- Square
- Smooth window operation

Adjust shims as needed before final fastening.

---

## 7. Air Sealing and Insulation

### 7.1 Interior Air Seal

- Use low-expansion window foam or backer rod with sealant
- Apply foam:
  - Between window frame and rough opening
  - Do not overfill cavities
- Seal interruptions caused by shims or clips

### 7.2 Interior Finish Seal

- Apply continuous interior sealant bead where frame meets drywall or interior stop
- This creates the primary air barrier

---

## 8. Exterior Sealing

### 8.1 Backer Rod and Sealant

- Install backer rod where gaps exceed 1/4"
- Apply continuous exterior sealant bead:
  - Between window frame and exterior stop or opening
- Do not block weep paths where drainage is required

### 8.2 Final Detailing

- Tool sealant for proper adhesion and finish
- Reinstall or install exterior trim as required

---

## 9. Final Inspection and Documentation

### 9.1 Verification Checklist

- Verify window operation
- Inspect interior and exterior seals
- Confirm flashing continuity
- Photograph:
  - Completed interior
  - Completed exterior
  - Sealant details
- Clean work area

## Field Notes

- Two installers are typically required for safe handling
- Water management always takes precedence over cosmetic alignment
- Window performance depends more on installation quality than product brand
