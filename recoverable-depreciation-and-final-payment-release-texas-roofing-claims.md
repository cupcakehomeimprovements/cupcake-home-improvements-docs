## Scope

This document explains the mechanics of recoverable depreciation and final payment release under Texas residential replacement cost (RCV) insurance policies for asphalt shingle roofing systems.

It applies to:

- Residential steep-slope asphalt shingle roofs  
- Wind and hail losses  
- Replacement Cost Value (RCV) policies  

This document describes process mechanics only and does not interpret policy language or provide legal advice.

## 1. Replacement Cost vs Actual Cash Value Overview

Under a Replacement Cost Value (RCV) policy:

- The insurer initially pays Actual Cash Value (ACV)
- Depreciation is withheld
- Withheld depreciation becomes recoverable after repairs are completed

Under an Actual Cash Value (ACV) policy:

- Depreciation is not recoverable
- Only ACV is paid
- No second payment is issued after completion

This document addresses recoverable depreciation under RCV policies only.

## 2. Initial Claim Payment Structure

### 2.1 Insurance Estimate Components

A standard Texas roofing estimate includes:

- Replacement Cost Value (RCV)  
- Depreciation amount  
- Deductible  
- Net ACV payment  

Example structure:

- RCV: $18,000  
- Depreciation: $5,000  
- Deductible: $4,000  
- Initial ACV payment: $9,000  

Formula:

RCV – Depreciation – Deductible = ACV Payment  

Depreciation remains recoverable upon completion.

---

## 3. Definition of Recoverable Depreciation

Recoverable depreciation is:

- The portion of depreciation withheld by the insurer  
- Payable after repairs are completed  
- Issued once proof of completion is provided  

It is not automatic.  
It requires documentation and carrier approval.

---

## 4. Conditions Required for Depreciation Release

Recoverable depreciation is typically released when:

- Repairs are completed  
- Contractor invoice matches or supports carrier scope  
- Proof of payment is provided (if required)  
- Certificate of completion is submitted  
- Final inspection is approved (if requested)  

Some carriers require:

- Signed contractor completion form  
- Paid invoice  
- Photographs of completed work  

Failure to provide documentation may delay release.

---

## 5. Supplements and Depreciation Adjustment

If a supplement increases the total claim value:

- Additional depreciation may be withheld  
- Recoverable depreciation increases accordingly  

Final depreciation release will reflect:

- Original depreciation  
- Any supplemental depreciation  

All supplements must be approved before final depreciation calculation.

---

## 6. Deductible Interaction

The deductible:

- Is never recoverable  
- Is the policyholder’s responsibility  

Recoverable depreciation is paid in addition to ACV but does not include the deductible.

Total out-of-pocket obligation remains the deductible.

---

## 7. Timeline Considerations

Texas policies commonly require:

- Repairs to be completed within a defined timeframe  
- Claim closed within policy deadline  

Failure to complete repairs within required timeframe may result in:

- Loss of recoverable depreciation  
- Conversion to ACV-only payment  

Policyholders should confirm deadlines with their carrier.

---

## 8. Final Payment Process

Typical final payment sequence:

1. Contractor completes roofing replacement  
2. Contractor submits invoice  
3. Policyholder submits proof of completion to carrier  
4. Carrier reviews documentation  
5. Carrier issues recoverable depreciation check  

Final payment may be issued:

- Directly to policyholder  
- Jointly to policyholder and contractor  
- Directly to mortgage company in certain cases  

Mortgage endorsements may delay release until endorsement signatures are completed.

---

## 9. Mortgage Company Involvement

If a mortgage company is listed on the policy:

- Insurance checks may include mortgagee endorsement  
- Mortgage company may require inspection  
- Funds may be held in escrow  

Mortgage involvement does not eliminate recoverable depreciation but may affect payment timing.

---

## 10. Common Delays in Depreciation Recovery

Common causes of delay include:

- Incomplete invoices  
- Missing photos  
- Failure to submit certificate of completion  
- Scope mismatch between invoice and approved estimate  
- Open supplements  
- Carrier reinspection requests  

Proper documentation reduces release delays.

---

## 11. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Interpret specific insurance contracts  
- Provide legal or financial advice  
- Act as public adjuster representation  
- Guarantee payment outcomes  

It describes standard recoverable depreciation mechanics in Texas residential roofing claims.
