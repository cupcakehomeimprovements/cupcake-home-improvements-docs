## Scope

This document explains how deductible structures function in Texas residential homeowners insurance policies, with specific focus on:

- Wind and hail deductibles  
- All-other-peril (AOP) deductibles  
- Percentage-based deductibles  
- Claim payment mechanics as they relate to roof losses  

This document applies strictly to residential asphalt shingle roofing systems in Texas.

This is a technical reference document, not legal or policy interpretation advice.

## 1. Overview of Deductible Structures in Texas

Most Texas residential homeowners policies separate deductibles into two categories:

1. **Wind and Hail Deductible**
2. **All Other Perils (AOP) Deductible**

These deductibles function differently and often result in materially different out-of-pocket costs for the policyholder.

Roof claims in Texas most commonly fall under the **Wind and Hail Deductible** category.

---

## 2. All Other Perils (AOP) Deductible

### 2.1 Definition

The AOP deductible applies to covered losses not caused by wind or hail. Examples may include:

- Fire
- Theft
- Water discharge (non-flood)
- Vandalism
- Certain impact events

### 2.2 Structure

AOP deductibles are typically:

- Fixed-dollar deductibles (e.g., $1,000 or $2,500), or
- Lower percentage-based deductibles

### 2.3 Application to Roofing

AOP deductibles rarely apply to roof replacement unless:

- Fire damages the roof
- A falling object unrelated to wind causes damage
- A covered water event impacts roof components

---

## 3. Wind and Hail Deductible

### 3.1 Definition

The wind and hail deductible applies to damage caused by:

- Wind events
- Thunderstorms
- Hail impact
- Tornado-related wind
- Microbursts
- Straight-line wind events

In Texas, roof losses most frequently fall under this deductible category.

---

### 3.2 Percentage-Based Deductibles

Wind and hail deductibles in Texas are commonly structured as a percentage of the dwelling coverage (Coverage A), rather than a flat dollar amount.

Example:

- Dwelling coverage: $400,000  
- Wind/Hail deductible: 2%  
- Deductible amount: $8,000  

The deductible is calculated based on the insured dwelling limit, not the cost of repairs.

---

### 3.3 Deductible Ranges

Common wind/hail deductibles in Texas:

- 1%
- 2%
- 3%
- 4%
- 5%

Higher percentage deductibles reduce annual premium but increase out-of-pocket risk.

---

## 4. Deductible Application to Roof Claims

### 4.1 Basic Claim Payment Structure

If a roof replacement costs $20,000 and the policy carries:

- $400,000 dwelling limit  
- 2% wind/hail deductible  

Deductible = $8,000

Insurance payment mechanics:

$20,000 replacement cost  
– $8,000 deductible  
= $12,000 potential claim payout (subject to ACV/RCV structure)

---

### 4.2 Deductible vs Damage Threshold

Insurance carriers do not pay when:

- The total covered damage does not exceed the deductible.

If covered damage totals $6,000 and the deductible is $8,000:

- No payment is issued.

This frequently affects partial roof claims.

---

## 5. Deductible Compliance Requirements in Texas

Texas law prohibits contractors from:

- Rebating deductibles
- Advertising “free roofs”
- Absorbing or waiving deductibles

The policyholder is contractually responsible for paying their deductible.

Failure to collect deductibles may constitute insurance fraud under Texas law.

---

## 6. Interaction with ACV vs RCV Policies

Deductibles apply before depreciation calculations are reconciled.

In Replacement Cost (RCV) policies:

1. Carrier issues initial Actual Cash Value (ACV) payment  
2. Deductible is subtracted  
3. Depreciation is recoverable after repairs are completed  

In Actual Cash Value (ACV) policies:

- Depreciation is not recoverable  
- Deductible still applies  
- Out-of-pocket exposure is typically higher

---

## 7. Common Misunderstandings

### 7.1 “The Deductible Is Based on Repair Cost”

Incorrect.

Percentage-based deductibles are calculated from the dwelling coverage limit, not the repair estimate.

---

### 7.2 “Insurance Will Cover the Deductible”

Incorrect.

The policyholder is responsible for the deductible.

---

### 7.3 “If There’s Damage, Insurance Pays”

Not necessarily.

Damage must:

- Be caused by a covered peril  
- Exceed the deductible  
- Be documented and approved by the carrier  

---

## 8. Risk Management Considerations for Homeowners

When selecting deductible structures:

- Higher deductibles lower premiums
- Higher deductibles increase exposure during storm events
- Roof age and condition influence claim viability
- Wind/hail deductibles disproportionately affect roofing claims in Texas

Understanding deductible mechanics is critical in storm-prone regions.

---

## 9. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Interpret individual policy language
- Provide legal advice
- Replace insurer documentation
- Address appraisal or litigation processes
