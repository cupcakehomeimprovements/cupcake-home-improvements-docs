## Texas Residential Asphalt Shingle – Field Interaction Standards

---

## About This Procedure

This document reflects field-informed insurance claim practices developed through residential roofing claim experience in Texas by **Cupcake Home Improvements**, a Central Texas exterior remodeling contractor specializing in roofing, windows, siding, and building envelope performance.

## Scope

This document outlines the standard field protocol for interacting with insurance adjusters during residential asphalt shingle roofing inspections related to wind and hail losses in Texas.

It applies strictly to:

- Residential structures  
- Steep-slope asphalt shingle roofing systems  
- Wind and hail-related claims  

This document defines observational standards, documentation procedures, and on-site interaction guidelines.

This is not a public adjuster guide and does not constitute legal representation.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Adjuster Inspection

An insurance adjuster inspection is conducted to:

- Confirm the cause of loss
- Determine whether damage is covered under the policy
- Assess scope and extent of covered damage
- Estimate repair or replacement cost

The adjuster represents the insurance carrier.

The contractor represents construction expertise and documents observable conditions.

---

## 2. Pre-Inspection Preparation

### 2.1 Site Review

Prior to adjuster arrival:

- Perform a full roof and attic inspection
- Identify documented hail or wind damage
- Photograph all slopes and elevations
- Mark potential damage locations with removable indicators (e.g., chalk)

Damage markings should be minimal and specific, not excessive.

---

### 2.2 Documentation Preparation

Prepare the following:

- Photo documentation organized by slope
- Attic photos (if relevant)
- Notes on storm date (if known)
- Observations of collateral indicators:
  - Soft metal impacts
  - Fence damage
  - Gutter dents
  - HVAC fin damage

Documentation should reflect observable conditions only.

---

## 3. On-Site Adjuster Interaction

### 3.1 Access and Safety

- Ensure safe ladder placement
- Confirm roof pitch and access safety
- Discuss fall protection if needed
- Provide attic access where applicable

Safety takes precedence over inspection access.

---

### 3.2 Roof Walk Protocol

During inspection:

- Walk slopes together when possible
- Allow adjuster to identify their test areas
- Point out documented damage areas calmly and factually
- Avoid argumentative or adversarial behavior

Statements should be observational, not speculative.

Example:

“Here is a circular granule displacement with fractured mat consistent with impact.”

Avoid:

“This roof needs to be bought.”

---

## 4. Hail Damage Discussion Standards

When discussing hail damage:

- Identify functional damage (mat fracture)
- Differentiate cosmetic vs functional impacts
- Discuss distribution across multiple slopes
- Reference soft metal confirmation points

In Texas, laminated asphalt shingles typically require:

- Sufficient hail size
- Consistent directional impact
- Multiple hits per test square

Damage discussion should focus on performance impairment, not aesthetics.

---

## 5. Wind Damage Discussion Standards

When discussing wind damage:

- Identify creased shingles at seal strip
- Note displaced or missing shingles
- Identify compromised fastener zones
- Observe broken sealant bonds

Wind damage must show mechanical compromise, not simple aging.

---

## 6. Collateral Indicators

Collateral damage supports cause-of-loss confirmation.

Common indicators:

- Dented metal vents
- Gutter and downspout impacts
- Damaged window screens
- Fence staining or spatter patterns

Collateral damage does not replace roof damage but strengthens storm validation.

---

## 7. Common Areas of Dispute

Adjuster inspections may involve disagreement over:

- Cosmetic vs functional damage
- Pre-existing wear vs storm damage
- Repairability vs full replacement
- Slope qualification thresholds
- Deductible applicability

Disputes should remain fact-based and documented.

---

## 8. Scope Review After Inspection

After the adjuster completes inspection:

- Request scope documentation when available
- Review:
  - Shingle quantities
  - Ridge length
  - Flashing items
  - Ventilation components
  - Code-required upgrades
- Compare scope against observable field conditions

Supplements may be required when scope omits necessary components.

---

## 9. Supplement Process (Contractor Role)

If discrepancies exist:

- Provide photo documentation
- Provide code references if applicable
- Submit line-item justifications
- Maintain professional communication

The contractor’s role is to document construction requirements — not negotiate policy interpretation.

---

## 10. Professional Conduct Standards

During all adjuster interactions:

- Remain factual
- Avoid policy interpretation statements
- Avoid promising coverage outcomes to homeowner
- Avoid adversarial tone
- Document all communication

Professional field credibility improves long-term claim outcomes.

---

## 11. Documentation Requirements

Upon completion:

- Photograph:
  - Test squares
  - Marked impacts
  - Collateral damage
  - Entire roof elevations
- Document slopes inspected and slopes denied
- Note inaccessible areas

Inspection limitations should be clearly recorded.

---

## 12. Scope Boundaries

This document does not:

- Interpret insurance policy language
- Provide public adjusting services
- Offer legal advice
- Guarantee claim approval
- Address appraisal or litigation procedures

It defines construction-level interaction protocol during residential roof claim inspections in Texas.
