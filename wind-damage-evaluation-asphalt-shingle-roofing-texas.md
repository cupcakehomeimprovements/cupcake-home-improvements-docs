## Scope

This document defines field standards for evaluating wind damage to residential steep-slope asphalt shingle roofing systems in Texas.

It applies to single-family and low-rise residential structures with laminated or 3-tab asphalt shingles.

This document focuses on physical damage identification, wind-related failure patterns, and documentation standards. It does not interpret insurance coverage, policy language, or claim outcomes.

## 1. Purpose of Wind Damage Evaluation

Wind damage evaluation seeks to determine:

- Whether shingle displacement is storm-related
- Whether damage is functional or cosmetic
- Whether failure patterns are consistent with wind uplift
- Whether repair or replacement scope may be warranted
- Whether damage appears recent or pre-existing

Evaluation must be based on observable physical indicators.

---

## 2. Wind Mechanics and Asphalt Shingle Response

Wind damage to asphalt shingles typically results from uplift forces acting at shingle edges.

Key factors influencing wind damage include:

- Wind speed and gust intensity
- Roof pitch and orientation
- Exposure category (urban, suburban, open terrain)
- Shingle age and sealant condition
- Fastener placement and pattern
- Previous installation quality

Wind uplift commonly initiates at:

- Eaves
- Rakes
- Ridges
- Hip caps
- Corners and perimeter zones

---

## 3. Primary Indicators of Wind Damage

### 3.1 Creased or Fractured Shingles

A wind-creased shingle typically exhibits:

- Horizontal fracture line through the mat
- Separation or cracking at the seal line
- Visible asphalt stress marks
- Granule displacement along crease line

Creasing indicates the shingle has been lifted and flexed beyond its design limits.

---

### 3.2 Missing Shingles

Missing shingles may indicate:

- Sealant bond failure under uplift pressure
- Improper fastening
- Edge zone exposure

Evaluation should include:

- Nail pattern examination
- Fastener pull-through
- Adjacent shingle integrity
- Pattern consistency across slope

---

### 3.3 Torn or Detached Tabs (3-Tab Systems)

On 3-tab shingles, wind damage may present as:

- Torn tabs at cutouts
- Partial tab loss
- Distortion at exposed edges

Damage patterns should be evaluated for consistency with directional wind flow.

---

### 3.4 Lifted or Unsealed Shingles

Unsealed shingles may:

- Lift easily when tested
- Exhibit failed sealant strips
- Show brittle adhesive

Distinguish between:

- Age-related seal failure
- Recent storm-induced uplift

Testing must not create additional damage.

---

## 4. Secondary Indicators

Wind events may also cause damage to related components:

- Ridge cap displacement
- Hip cap loosening
- Metal flashing displacement
- Gutter detachment
- Fascia damage
- Soffit panel movement

Collateral damage to soft metals, fencing, or tree limbs may support wind-related causation.

---

## 5. Distinguishing Wind Damage from Other Conditions

Wind damage must be differentiated from:

- Thermal cracking
- Manufacturing defects
- Blistering
- Foot traffic damage
- Improper installation
- Fastener over-driving
- Nail pops unrelated to uplift

Random cracking without directional pattern is typically not wind-related.

Improper nailing patterns may increase vulnerability but are not, by themselves, proof of wind damage.

---

## 6. Texas-Specific Considerations

In Central Texas and surrounding regions:

- Wind events often accompany hailstorms
- Microbursts and straight-line winds are common
- Perimeter uplift is more common on higher-pitched roofs
- Heat aging accelerates sealant failure, increasing uplift susceptibility

Evaluate weather event timing relative to:

- Reported storm dates
- Local wind advisories
- Observed collateral damage in the neighborhood

---

## 7. Documentation Standards

Wind damage evaluation requires systematic documentation:

- Photograph each elevation
- Photograph representative damage close-up
- Capture wide shots showing slope distribution
- Document ridge and hip conditions
- Photograph nail pattern if shingle is displaced
- Photograph collateral property damage
- Document areas free of damage for context

Photographs should include:

- Overall slope view
- Close-up of crease or tear
- Adjacent intact shingles
- Edge zones and corners

All findings must be documented without assumption of coverage.

---

## 8. Repairability Considerations

Wind damage repair feasibility may depend on:

- Shingle brittleness
- Color match availability
- Seal strip condition
- Age and exposure
- Extent of creasing

Spot repair on brittle shingles may cause additional damage.

Repair feasibility must be evaluated carefully before removal attempts.

---

## 9. Common Failure Patterns in Texas Wind Events

Observed patterns may include:

- Perimeter-only damage
- Directional creasing consistent with prevailing winds
- Ridge cap displacement without field damage
- Mixed wind and hail indicators
- Damage concentrated on one slope

Uniform interior slope cracking without edge involvement may suggest non-wind causation.

---

## 10. Inspection Limitations

Wind damage evaluation is limited to observable conditions at the time of inspection.

Hidden mat fractures or partial bond failures may not be visible without manipulation.

Evaluation does not determine insurance liability, coverage approval, or claim payment.

---

## Notes

- Wind damage must be distinguished from installation defects.
- Not all lifted shingles are storm-related.
- Age-related sealant failure increases uplift susceptibility.
- Evaluation should remain objective and evidence-based.
