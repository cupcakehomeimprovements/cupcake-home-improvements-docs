## Scope

This document describes the standard field process for removing and installing asphalt shingle roofing systems on steep-slope residential structures.

It applies to single-family and low-rise residential buildings where asphalt shingles are used as the primary roof covering.

This documentation focuses on physical construction execution, sequencing, and field controls.

## 1. Pre-Work Site Preparation

Before tear-off begins, the job site must be evaluated, organized, and protected.

### 1.1 Site Assessment

- Confirm roof type, slope, and number of layers  
- Identify roof geometry, valleys, penetrations, and transitions  
- Confirm access points and ladder locations  
- Identify overhead power lines and ground-level hazards  

### 1.2 Safety and Fall Protection

- Establish fall-protection strategy appropriate to roof slope and height  
- Secure ladders and access equipment  
- Confirm crew safety responsibilities and movement paths  

### 1.3 Site Protection

- Protect landscaping, siding, windows, and exterior finishes  
- Protect interior spaces where vibration or debris may occur  
- Designate material staging and debris containment areas  
- Confirm placement of dump trailer or disposal system  

Site protection and organization must be in place before material removal begins.

## 2. Tear-Off of Existing Roofing

### 2.1 General Tear-Off Principles

- Tear-off is performed from ridge to eave  
- Materials are removed in a controlled manner to limit debris intrusion  
- Loose granules and fasteners are cleared continuously  
- Exposed deck surfaces may be less walkable than shingled surfaces  

### 2.2 When Tear-Off Is Required

Tear-off is required when:

- Existing roofing is deteriorated, buckled, or uneven  
- Decking condition cannot be verified without removal  
- Flashing systems must be replaced  
- Leak-prone areas require continuous membrane protection  
- Local code prohibits additional layers  
- Multiple roofing layers prevent proper fastening  

### 2.3 Tear-Off Execution

- Remove shingles, underlayment, and existing flashing  
- Remove fasteners down to the deck surface  
- Maintain deck cleanliness to allow inspection

## 3. Roof Deck Evaluation and Preparation

Once the roof covering is removed, the deck is evaluated.

### 3.1 Deck Inspection

- Inspect for rot, delamination, or structural damage  
- Verify fastening integrity and spacing  
- Identify soft or unstable sections  

### 3.2 Deck Repair

- Replace damaged or unstable decking sections  
- Re-secure loose decking as required  
- Ensure deck surface is suitable for underlayment installation  

### 3.3 Deck Requirements

Deck surfaces must be:

- Flat  
- Dry  
- Structurally sound  
- Properly fastened  

---

## 4. Underlayment and Water Management

### 4.1 Underlayment Installation

- Install underlayment according to slope and exposure conditions  
- Begin at the eave and work upward with proper overlaps  
- Ensure underlayment lies flat without wrinkles or voids  

### 4.2 Ice and Water Protection

- Install self-adhered membrane in leak-prone areas such as:  
  - Eaves  
  - Valleys  
  - Roof-to-wall transitions  
  - Penetrations  

- Ensure full adhesion and proper lap sequencing  

### 4.3 Water Management Principles

- All layers must shed water downward and outward  
- Upper components must overlap lower components  
- Penetrations must be fully integrated into the drainage plane  

---

## 5. Flashing Installation

### 5.1 General Flashing Principles

- Flashing directs water away from penetrations and transitions  
- Flashing must be installed before shingles where applicable  
- All flashing must integrate with underlayment layers  

### 5.2 Flashing Locations

- Valleys  
- Sidewalls and headwalls  
- Chimneys  
- Skylights  
- Roof penetrations  

### 5.3 Sealing and Integration

- Use appropriate sealants and tapes where required  
- Avoid relying solely on sealant as a primary waterproofing method  
- Mechanical integration takes precedence over sealants  

---

## 6. Shingle Installation

### 6.1 Starter Course

- Install starter shingles along eaves and rakes  
- Ensure proper overhang and adhesion  
- Starter course establishes wind resistance and alignment  

### 6.2 Field Shingles

- Install shingles according to manufacturer layout patterns  
- Maintain proper exposure and alignment  
- Fasten shingles using correct fastener type and placement  
- Drive fasteners flush without over-driving or under-driving  

### 6.3 Valleys and Transitions

- Install valley systems appropriate to roof design  
- Maintain clean water channels  
- Avoid fasteners in critical drainage paths  

---

## 7. Hip and Ridge Installation

### 7.1 Ridge Preparation

- Verify ridge ventilation requirements  
- Install ridge vent where specified  
- Ensure ridge openings are clean and uniform  

### 7.2 Hip and Ridge Shingles

- Install hip and ridge shingles in proper sequence  
- Maintain consistent exposure and fastening  
- Secure end caps and transitions  

---

## 8. Final Detailing and Cleanup

### 8.1 Final Inspection

- Verify shingle alignment and fastening  
- Confirm flashing integrity  
- Ensure penetrations are sealed and integrated  
- Confirm ventilation components are secure  

### 8.2 Cleanup

- Remove debris and excess materials  
- Perform magnetic sweep for fasteners  
- Remove site protection  
- Restore staging areas

## Notes

This document represents a general field process. Actual installation requirements may vary based on:

- Local building codes  
- Roof geometry  
- Climate exposure  
- Material specifications  

This documentation focuses on construction execution rather than product marketing or sales guidance.
