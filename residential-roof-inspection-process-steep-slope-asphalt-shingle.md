# Roof Inspection Process  
## Residential Steep-Slope Asphalt Shingle Roofing

---

## Scope

This document describes the standard field inspection process for evaluating existing residential steep-slope roofing systems prior to repair or replacement.

The inspection focuses on observable conditions, installation quality, material performance, ventilation, water management, and site constraints.  
It is intended to document existing conditions and inform construction scope — not to provide pricing, sales guidance, or insurance interpretation.

All observations should be documented with photographs where possible.

## Inspection Overview

A complete roof inspection includes:

- Interior (attic) inspection
- Exterior roof surface inspection
- Perimeter and component inspection
- Ventilation assessment
- Drainage and water management review
- Structural and substrate indicators
- Site access and logistics evaluation
- Documentation via photographs and, when available, drone imagery

## 1. Interior / Attic Inspection

### 1.1 Decking Condition (Underside)

Inspect the underside of roof decking for:

- Active leaks or moisture staining
- Darkened wood, rot, or delamination
- Mold or mildew patterns
- Nail penetrations protruding through decking
- Sagging or uneven decking planes

### 1.2 Ventilation (Interior Evidence)

Evaluate ventilation from inside the attic:

- Presence and location of intake vents (soffit, eave)
- Presence and location of exhaust vents (ridge, box, turbine, gable)
- Evidence of short-circuiting (intake air exhausting immediately)
- Blocked, crushed, or obstructed vents
- Signs of inadequate airflow (heat buildup, condensation)

Measure:
- Attic air temperature using an infrared temperature gun at multiple locations

- Vent openings
- Blocked or improperly installed ventilation components

### 1.3 Insulation Evaluation

Document insulation conditions:

- Insulation type (fiberglass, cellulose, spray foam, etc.)
- Approximate depth and coverage
- Voids, compression, or uneven distribution
- Evidence of moisture intrusion within insulation

Photograph:
- Representative insulation coverage
- Areas of missing or damaged insulation

### 1.4 Mechanical Systems & Penetrations

Identify and document:

- HVAC equipment located in attic
- Duct routing and roof penetrations
- Condensate lines or exhaust penetrations
- Evidence of moisture related to mechanical systems

Photograph:
- Roof penetrations from inside attic
- Any signs of leaks related to mechanical systems

### 1.5 Biological Activity

Inspect for signs of animals or infestation:

- Droppings
- Nesting material
- Chewed decking or wiring
- Entry points at eaves or penetrations

Photograph:
- Any evidence of animal activity or infestation

## 2. Exterior Roof Surface Inspection

### 2.1 Shingle Condition

Inspect shingles for:

- Granule loss or excessive granule accumulation
- Brittleness or cracking
- Curling, cupping, or blistering
- Missing, torn, or displaced shingles
- Evidence of wind lift or creasing
- Impact marks consistent with hail or debris

Photograph:
- Representative shingle conditions
- All damaged or missing shingles

---

### 2.2 Storm & Wear Indicators

Document evidence of:

- Wind damage patterns
- Impact damage
- Mechanical damage (foot traffic, tools, prior work)
- Accelerated aging or uneven wear

Photograph:
- All suspected storm-related damage
- Areas of abnormal wear

---

### 2.3 Roof Geometry & Drainage

Evaluate roof layout and water flow:

- Roof pitch and slope changes
- Valleys (open vs closed)
- Dead valleys or low-slope transitions
- Chimney crickets (presence or absence)
- Areas of water concentration or debris buildup

Photograph:
- Valleys and slope transitions
- Chimney areas and drainage paths

## 3. Flashing & Penetrations

### 3.1 Flashing Systems

Inspect flashing at:

- Chimneys
- Wall abutments
- Dormers
- Skylights
- Roof-to-wall transitions

Look for:
- Corrosion
- Improper overlap or sequencing
- Excessive reliance on sealant
- Missing or improperly integrated flashing

Photograph:
- Each flashing location
- Any signs of failure or misapplication

---

### 3.2 Pipe Boots & Roof Penetrations

Inspect:

- Plumbing vent boots
- Exhaust vents
- Satellite or utility penetrations

Document:
- Cracked or deteriorated rubber
- Corrosion
- Improper sealing
- Prior temporary repairs

Photograph:
- Each penetration
- Close-ups of deteriorated components

---

## 4. Edge Metal & Perimeter Components

Inspect perimeter details including:

- Drip edge at eaves and rakes
- Gutter apron vs standard drip edge
- Integration of drip edge with underlayment
- Fascia condition
- Hidden rot behind fascia or wrap

Photograph:
- Drip edge presence or absence
- Fascia damage or rot

---

## 5. Ventilation (Exterior Confirmation)

Confirm exterior ventilation components:

- Type and quantity of exhaust vents
- Ridge vent continuity and condition
- Decorative vs functional vents
- Evidence of blocked soffit intake

Photograph:
- All ventilation components
- Intake and exhaust locations

---

## 6. Structural & Substrate Indicators

Observe for signs of structural concerns:

- Sagging roof planes
- Uneven ridgelines
- Nail pops visible through shingles
- Deck thickness inconsistencies (where observable)

Photograph:
- Sagging or uneven areas
- Nail pops or surface irregularities

---

## 7. Existing Installation Quality

Identify evidence of prior installation issues:

- Over-driven or under-driven fasteners
- High nailing patterns
- Improper shingle offset or patterning
- Missing or incorrect starter course
- Improper valley construction
- Inconsistent fastener spacing

Photograph:
- Exposed fasteners
- Patterning issues
- Improper starter or edge details

---

## 8. Roofing Layers & Underlayment

Determine:

- Number of existing shingle layers
- Visible underlayment type (where accessible)
- Evidence of improper layering or trapped materials

Photograph:
- Layer exposure at edges or penetrations

---

## 9. Site Access & Logistics Evaluation

Assess site conditions that may impact installation:

- Roof height and pitch
- Safe ladder placement locations
- Fall protection considerations
- Overhead power line proximity
- Neighboring structures or property constraints
- Vehicle access limitations
- Material staging areas
- Dump trailer placement constraints

Photograph:
- Access points
- Obstructions or constraints

---

## 10. Drone Documentation (When Available)

If a drone is available:

- Capture images of each roof elevation
- Document overall roof geometry
- Capture inaccessible or steep areas
- Photograph valleys, ridges, and transitions

Drone imagery should supplement — not replace — physical inspection where safe access is possible.

---

## Documentation Standards

- Photograph all notable conditions
- Capture both close-up and contextual images
- Label or organize photos by elevation and component
- Note areas that could not be safely accessed
- Document inspection limitations when present

---

## Inspection Limitations

Inspection findings are limited to observable conditions at the time of inspection.  
Hidden damage or concealed conditions may not be detectable without material removal.
