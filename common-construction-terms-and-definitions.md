## Scope

This document defines commonly used construction terms relevant to residential exterior construction.

It includes general construction terminology as well as trade-specific terms related to roofing, windows, siding, and gutter systems.

Definitions are provided for technical clarity and field accuracy.

This document is intended for reference only. It does not provide installation instructions.

## 1. General Construction Terms

### 1.1 Plumb
A condition where a surface or component is vertically aligned relative to gravity.

### 1.2 Level
A condition where a surface is horizontally aligned relative to gravity.

### 1.3 Square
A condition where intersecting components meet at a true 90-degree angle.

### 1.4 Substrate
The underlying surface or material to which another material is applied or attached.

### 1.5 Sheathing
Structural panels installed over framing that provide rigidity and a fastening surface for exterior materials.

### 1.6 Load Path
The route through which structural loads are transferred to the foundation.

### 1.7 Differential Movement
Uneven movement between structural components, often due to soil conditions or settlement.

### 1.8 Thermal Bridging
Heat transfer through materials with higher conductivity that bypass insulation.

### 1.9 R-Value
A measure of thermal resistance. Higher values indicate greater insulating effectiveness.

### 1.10 Expansion and Contraction
Material movement caused by temperature changes.

### 1.11 Fastener Penetration
The depth at which a fastener embeds into a structural component to achieve holding strength.

## 2. Water Management and Flashing Terms

### 2.1 Water-Resistive Barrier (WRB)
A continuous layer designed to manage bulk water behind exterior cladding.

### 2.2 Drainage Plane
The surface within a wall assembly that directs water downward and outward.

### 2.3 Flashing
Materials installed to redirect water at transitions, penetrations, and terminations.

### 2.4 Shingled Lapping
A layering method where upper materials overlap lower materials to promote drainage.

### 2.5 Kickout Flashing
A diverter installed at roof-to-wall intersections to direct water away from walls.

### 2.6 Drip Edge
Metal flashing installed at roof edges to control water flow and protect fascia.

### 2.7 Counterflashing
Secondary flashing that covers step flashing or penetrations to prevent water intrusion.

### 2.8 Capillary Action
Water movement through narrow gaps due to surface tension.

### 2.9 End Dam
A raised edge in flashing that prevents water from escaping laterally.

## 3. Roofing Terms

### 3.1 Roof Decking
The structural surface installed over roof framing to which roofing materials are applied.

### 3.2 Underlayment
A secondary protective layer installed beneath roofing materials.

### 3.3 Ice and Water Protection
Self-adhered membrane used in areas prone to water backup.

### 3.4 Valley
The internal angle formed where two roof planes meet.

### 3.5 Ridge
The horizontal peak where two roof planes intersect.

### 3.6 Hip
The external angle formed where roof planes slope downward from a ridge.

### 3.7 Step Flashing
Individual flashing pieces installed with each course of roofing along vertical surfaces.

### 3.8 Pipe Boot
A flashing assembly designed to seal around roof penetrations.

### 3.9 Granule Loss
The shedding of protective surface granules from asphalt shingles.

### 3.10 Wind Uplift Rating
A measure of a roofing system’s resistance to wind forces.

## 4. Window and Opening Terms

### 4.1 Rough Opening
The framed opening in a wall designed to receive a window or door.

### 4.2 Block Frame Window
A replacement window without a nail fin, designed for retrofit installation.

### 4.3 Cut-Back Installation
A window installation method involving removal of interior finishes to expose the wall opening, allowing improved water and air sealing continuity.

### 4.4 Pocket-Fit Installation
A window installation method where the replacement window is set into an existing frame with minimal disturbance to surrounding finishes.

### 4.5 Sill
The bottom horizontal portion of a window opening.

### 4.6 Head
The top horizontal portion of a window opening.

### 4.7 Jamb
The vertical sides of a window opening.

### 4.8 Sill Pan
A flashing system designed to manage water at the bottom of an opening.

### 4.9 Low-Expansion Foam
Insulating foam designed to seal openings without exerting pressure on frames.

### 4.10 U-Factor
A measure of heat transfer through a window assembly. Lower values indicate better performance.

### 4.11 Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)
A measure of how much solar heat passes through glazing.

### 4.12 STC Rating
A measure of a window’s ability to reduce sound transmission.

## 5. Siding Terms

### 5.1 Cladding
The exterior material applied to walls for protection and appearance.

### 5.2 Fiber Cement Siding
A composite siding material made from cement, sand, and cellulose fibers.

### 5.3 Exposure
The visible height of a siding course after installation.

### 5.4 Butt Joint
A vertical joint where two siding boards meet end-to-end.

### 5.5 Joint Flashing
Material installed behind siding joints to manage water intrusion.

### 5.6 Clearance
Required separation between siding and adjacent surfaces to prevent moisture damage.

### 5.7 Starter Strip
A component used to establish the correct angle and alignment for the first siding course.

### 5.8 Field Cut Edge
An edge created when siding is cut on site that requires sealing.

### 5.9 Face Nailing
Fastening method where fasteners remain visible on the surface.

### 5.10 Blind Nailing
Fastening method where fasteners are concealed by overlapping courses.

## 6. Gutter and Drainage Terms

### 6.1 Gutter Run
A continuous length of gutter installed along a roof edge.

### 6.2 Downspout
A vertical pipe that directs water from the gutter to the ground.

### 6.3 Splashback
Water rebounding off hard surfaces near discharge points.

### 6.4 Fascia
The board installed at the roof edge that supports gutters.

### 6.5 Rafter Tail
The exposed end of a roof rafter at the eave.

### 6.6 Zip Screw
A self-drilling screw commonly used for metal attachments.

### 6.7 Rivet
A permanent mechanical fastener used for securing downspout seams.

### 6.8 Slope (Pitch)
The intentional angle of a gutter run to promote drainage.
