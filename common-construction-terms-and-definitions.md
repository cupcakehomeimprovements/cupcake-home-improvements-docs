## Scope

This document defines commonly used construction terms relevant to residential exterior construction. It includes general construction terminology as well as trade-specific terms related to roofing, windows, siding, and gutter systems.

Definitions are provided for technical clarity and field accuracy.  
This document is intended for reference, not instruction.

## 1. General Construction Terms

### Plumb
A condition where a surface or component is vertically aligned relative to gravity.

### Level
A condition where a surface is horizontally aligned relative to gravity.

### Square
A condition where intersecting components meet at a true 90-degree angle.

### Substrate
The underlying surface or material to which another material is applied or attached.

### Sheathing
Structural panels installed over framing that provide rigidity and a fastening surface for exterior materials.

### Load Path
The route through which structural loads are transferred to the foundation.

### Differential Movement
Uneven movement between structural components, often due to soil conditions or settlement.

### Thermal Bridging
Heat transfer through materials with higher conductivity that bypass insulation.

### R-Value
A measure of thermal resistance. Higher values indicate greater insulating effectiveness.

### Expansion and Contraction
Material movement caused by temperature changes.

### Fastener Penetration
The depth at which a fastener embeds into a structural component to achieve holding strength.

## 2. Water Management and Flashing Terms

### Water-Resistive Barrier (WRB)
A continuous layer designed to manage bulk water behind exterior cladding.

### Drainage Plane
The surface within a wall assembly that directs water downward and outward.

### Flashing
Materials installed to redirect water at transitions, penetrations, and terminations.

### Shingled Lapping
A layering method where upper materials overlap lower materials to promote drainage.

### Kickout Flashing
A diverter installed at roof-to-wall intersections to direct water away from walls.

### Drip Edge
Metal flashing installed at roof edges to control water flow and protect fascia.

### Counterflashing
Secondary flashing that covers step flashing or penetrations to prevent water intrusion.

### Capillary Action
Water movement through narrow gaps due to surface tension.

### End Dam
A raised edge in flashing that prevents water from escaping laterally.

---

## 3. Roofing Terms

### Roof Decking
The structural surface installed over roof framing to which roofing materials are applied.

### Underlayment
A secondary protective layer installed beneath roofing materials.

### Ice and Water Protection
Self-adhered membrane used in areas prone to water backup.

### Valley
The internal angle formed where two roof planes meet.

### Ridge
The horizontal peak where two roof planes intersect.

### Hip
The external angle formed where roof planes slope downward from a ridge.

### Step Flashing
Individual flashing pieces installed with each course of roofing along vertical surfaces.

### Pipe Boot
A flashing assembly designed to seal around roof penetrations.

### Granule Loss
The shedding of protective surface granules from asphalt shingles.

### Wind Uplift Rating
A measure of a roofing system’s resistance to wind forces.

---

## 4. Window and Opening Terms

### Rough Opening
The framed opening in a wall designed to receive a window or door.

### Block Frame Window
A replacement window without a nail fin, designed for retrofit installation.

### Cut-Back Installation
A window installation method involving removal of interior finishes to expose the wall opening, allowing improved water and air sealing continuity.

### Pocket-Fit Installation
A window installation method where the replacement window is set into an existing frame with minimal disturbance to surrounding finishes.

### Sill
The bottom horizontal portion of a window opening.

### Head
The top horizontal portion of a window opening.

### Jamb
The vertical sides of a window opening.

### Sill Pan
A flashing system designed to manage water at the bottom of an opening.

### Low-Expansion Foam
Insulating foam designed to seal openings without exerting pressure on frames.

### U-Factor
A measure of heat transfer through a window assembly. Lower values indicate better performance.

### Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)
A measure of how much solar heat passes through glazing.

### STC Rating
A measure of a window’s ability to reduce sound transmission.

---

## 5. Siding Terms

### Cladding
The exterior material applied to walls for protection and appearance.

### Fiber Cement Siding
A composite siding material made from cement, sand, and cellulose fibers.

### Exposure
The visible height of a siding course after installation.

### Butt Joint
A vertical joint where two siding boards meet end-to-end.

### Joint Flashing
Material installed behind siding joints to manage water intrusion.

### Clearance
Required separation between siding and adjacent surfaces to prevent moisture damage.

### Starter Strip
A component used to establish the correct angle and alignment for the first siding course.

### Field Cut Edge
An edge created when siding is cut on site that requires sealing.

### Face Nailing
Fastening method where fasteners remain visible on the surface.

### Blind Nailing
Fastening method where fasteners are concealed by overlapping courses.

---

## 6. Gutter and Drainage Terms

### Gutter Run
A continuous length of gutter installed along a roof edge.

### Downspout
A vertical pipe that directs water from the gutter to the ground.

### Splashback
Water rebounding off hard surfaces near discharge points.

### Fascia
The board installed at the roof edge that supports gutters.

### Rafter Tail
The exposed end of a roof rafter at the eave.

### Zip Screw
A self-drilling screw commonly used for metal attachments.

### Rivet
A permanent mechanical fastener used for securing downspout seams.

### Slope (Pitch)
The intentional angle of a gutter run to promote drainage.

### Overflow Condition
Water exceeding gutter capacity during heavy rainfall.

### Discharge Zone
The area where water exits the downspout.
